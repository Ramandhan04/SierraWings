**Project Prompt: Sierra Wings - Emergency Drone Delivery System (Production-Ready)**

---

### 🏥 Overview:

Sierra Wings is a cutting-edge medical drone delivery system that leverages real-time tracking, secure cloud architecture, and AI-driven logistics to deliver life-saving medical supplies to remote, underserved, or disaster-affected areas. Hospitals, clinics, and patients can request deliveries through a secure, responsive app. Drone operators and admins manage the logistics with full transparency and control.

### 📱 Key Modules:

#### 1. **User Types & Authentication**

* **Admin**: Access to system-wide logs, analytics, user tracking (hospital & patients), drone telemetry, payment logs. Requires Developer Secret Code: `7267`
* **Hospital/Clinic**: Can request drone deliveries, view historical records, upload documents. Requires Hospital Secret Code: `3499`
* **Customer/Patient**: Can sign up, order medication, make payments, and track delivery in real-time.

**Authentication Requirements**:

* Role-based access control with JWT.
* Secret code validation for Admin and Hospital roles.
* 2FA authentication for Admin and Hospital accounts.
