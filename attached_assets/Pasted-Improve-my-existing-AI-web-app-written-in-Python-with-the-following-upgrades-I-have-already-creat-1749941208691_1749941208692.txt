Improve my existing AI web app (written in Python) with the following upgrades. I have already created the frontend and backend; I just need you to complete these features and connect them properly. Use Firebase as the backend database and make sure the following requirements are implemented fully and correctly:

1. üîê USER AUTHENTICATION:
- Use Firebase Authentication
- Implement secure email/password registration
- Add role-based access for:
  - Admin (code: 7267)
  - Hospital (code: 3499)
  - Patient/Customer (no code needed)
- Add secret code check during registration for Admin and Hospital
- Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected pages

2. ‚úÖ EMAIL VERIFICATION & 2FA:
- After registration, send a verification code to the user‚Äôs email
- Before login is allowed, user must verify email via the code
- Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) by sending a unique OTP to the user's email at login
- OTP must expire after a few minutes and be securely validated

3. üì± RESPONSIVE UI/UX DESIGN:
- Make the entire web app mobile-friendly (iOS, Android)
- Adjust layout for smaller screens using CSS media queries or responsive frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Make the interface adaptive for desktop views too ‚Äî clean layout, not tight or broken
- Use standard best practices for modern responsive UI

4. ‚öôÔ∏è FIREBASE CONNECTION:
- Integrate Firebase Admin SDK in Python
- Ensure Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore is connected and stores:
  - User data (with roles)
  - Auth verification logs
  - Delivery requests and logs
- Use environment variables for all Firebase credentials (DO NOT hardcode secrets)

5. üíå NOTIFICATIONS:
- Send confirmation emails on:
  - Successful registration
  - OTP code for 2FA login
  - Drone delivery request success
- Use Python‚Äôs `smtplib` or a mail service like SendGrid or Gmail API

6. üöÄ FINALIZE & TEST:
- Make everything production-ready
- Ensure the login and registration process is secure and works across all devices
- Validate Firebase, OTP, and email services work end-to-end

Work in the existing Python project. Do not generate a demo ‚Äî make the code live and functional inside Replit with working Firebase + 2FA + UI improvements.
